Initialize empty repo: git init

To install all required packages needed for the project:
            pip install -r requirements.txt 

why do we need setup.py?
    We need setup.py so that later we can install our project like any other library (from PyPI), 
    or package it and give it to someone else to work together.
    Packaging is important because different versions behave differently and 
    people may forget to install required libraries.

Run commands:
    python src/logger.py
    python src/components/data_ingestion.py
