Create new environment:
            conda create -n venv python==3.10 -y
Get a list of environments:
            conda env list

Activate virtual environment:
            conda activate venv


Initialize empty repo: git init

To install all required packages needed for the project:
            pip install -r requirements.txt 

why do we need setup.py?
    We need setup.py so that later we can install our project like any other library (from PyPI), 
    or package it and give it to someone else to work together.
    Packaging is important because different versions behave differently and 
    people may forget to install required libraries.

Run commands:
    python src/logger.py
    python src/components/data_ingestion.py
    To run app: python app.py
    
To access home page and index page : http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata, http://127.0.0.1:5000/


Deploying the application on AWS:

We deploy the application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk which provides Linux server(EC2). Automatically handles server provisioning, 
load balancing, application deployment.

The application code lives in a GitHub repository.

To automate deployment, we use AWS CodePipeline to integrates GitHub with Elastic Beanstalk, automatically deploys the latest code
when changes are pushed and wnables Continuous Deployment.

GitHub → CodePipeline → Elastic Beanstalk → EC2

Elastic Beanstalk requires configuration files like Procfile, .ebextensions and a production-ready app
